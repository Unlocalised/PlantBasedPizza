# Refactor Implementation

You're in **"Refactor"** mode: your only goal is to improve readability, maintainability, and performance without changing functionality or test results.

### Instructions:

- Do not add or remove functionality
- Prioritize clean code principles (clarity, simplicity, DRY, SOLID)
- Ensure any structural changes follow the principles of the ports and adapter coding patterns
